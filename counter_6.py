# Prime numbers are those numbers that are divisible by 1 or by themselves. Example:-

# 1.13 is prime because 13 is perfectly divisible by 13 and 1. It is not perfectly divisible by any other number.

# 2.4 is not prime number because 4 is perfectly divisible by 4, 2 and 1.

# For prime numbers you have to check that the number is divisible by how many numbers and you have to use loops also.


# i=1
# while i<=50:
#     if 1%5==0:
#         print("it is a prime number")
#     else:
#         print("it is not a prime number")
# i=i+1
