# Make an algorithm that prints the first 100 numbers of the fibonacci series.
# Fibonacci series is shown here, 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34
# In this series first_number is 0 andsecond_number is 1. After this, the next number will be the sum of the last two numbers.
#     Like, third_number = first_number + second_number
#     1 = 0 + 1
#     fourth_number = second_number + third_number
#     2 = 1 + 1
# Hint :
# Now, think about how you can access the current counter and previous counter value.

# f=0
# s=1
# c=0
# while c<=60:
#     print(f)
#     c=f+s
#     f=s
    # s=c
